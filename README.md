# Usage and Features: The Multifaceted TourHub Experience

Welcome to TourHub, more than just a calculatorâ€”it's your ultimate sales enablement platform. Designed specifically for my wife to present her compelling premium and gift offerings to potential guests, TourHub streamlines the entire guest onboarding process.

## Tours Page: Your Control Center

At the heart of TourHub is the "Tours" page, engineered to be a comprehensive management system. Here, users can:

- **Track Guest Sign-ups**: Keep an organized record of each guest signed up for a tour with a sales representative.
  
- **Dynamic 'Pay Per Tour' Calculation**: The platform allows for manual input of a fluctuating number that represents the "pay per tour." This number is then automatically adjusted by subtracting the value of the chosen premium, generating an accurate pay per tour figure.

- **Ownership Status**: Conveniently indicate whether guests own or do not own property with the hotel, offering valuable context for each interaction.
  
- **Effortless Editing**: Modify saved guest information with ease and accuracy.
  
## User Authentication for Enhanced Security
  
To ensure privacy and data integrity, the Tours page is safeguarded by robust user authentication features, including:

- **User Sign-up**: New users can easily create an account.
  
- **User Login**: Returning users can securely access their data.
  
As a result, the Tours page remains inaccessible unless you are logged in, providing a secure and reliable experience.

## Optimized for Multiple Devices
  
TourHub has been optimized for a seamless experience across phones, desktops, and tablets, instilling confidence regardless of your chosen device.
